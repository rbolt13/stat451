## Definitions 

> The term **probability** refers to the study of randomness and uncertainty. 

> An **experiment** is any activity or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty. 

> The **sample space** of an experiment, denoted by $\mathscr{S}$, is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. 

> An **event** is any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space $\mathscr{S}$. An event is **simple** if it consists of exactly one outcome and **compound** if it consists of more than one outcome. 

> 1. The **complement** of an event A, denoted by $A'$, is the set of all outcomes in $\mathscr{S}$ that are not contained in A. 
> 2. The **union** of two events A and B, dentoed by $A\cup B$ and read "A or B", is the event consisting of all outcomes that are either in A or in B or in both events (so that the union includes outcomes for which both A and B occur as well as outcomes for which exactly one occurs) - that is, all outcomes in at least one of the events. 
> 3. The **intersection** of two events A and B, denoted by $A\cap B$ and read "A and B", is the event consisting of all outcomes that are in *both* A and B. 

> Let $\emptyset$ denote the *null event* (the event consisting of no outcomes whatsoever). When $A\cap B=\emptyset$, A and B are said to be **mutually exclusive** or **disjoing** events.

## Theorems and Axioms 

> **Axiom 1. : **For any event A, $P(A)\geq 0$. 

* the chance of A occuring should be nonnegative 

> **Axiom 2. : **$P(\mathscr{S} =1)$.

* $\mathscr{S}$ contains all possible outcomes

> **Axiom 3. : **If $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, ... is an infinite collection of disjoint events, then $$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup_2 A_3\cup ...)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)$$

* the chance that least one event will occur, and no two events can occur simultaneously, is the sum of the chances of the individual events. 

> **Proposition : **$P(\emptyset )=0$ where $\emptyset$ is the null evetn (the event containing no outcomes whatsoever).  This in turn implies that the property contained in **Axiom 3** is valid for a *finite* collection of dijoint events. 

> **Proposition : **For any event A, $P(A)+P(A')=1$, from which $P(A)=1-P(A')$

> **Proposition : **For any event A, $P(A)\leq 1$.

> **Proposition : **For any two events A and B, $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
