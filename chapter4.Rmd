# Definitions

> Let $X$ be a continuous random variable. Then a **probability distribution** or **probability density function** (pdf) of $X$ is a funciton $f(x)$ such that any two numbers a and b with $a\leq b$, $$P(\alpha \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$$ That is, the probability that $X$ takes on a value in the interval $[a,b]$ is the area above this interval and under the graph of the density funciton, as illustrated in **Figure 4.2** . The graph of $f(x)$ is often referred to as the *density curve*.

> A continuous random variable $X$ is said to have a **uniform distribution** on the interval $[A,B]$ if the pdf of $X$ is $$f(x;A,B) = { \frac{1}{B-A} : A \leq x \leq B , 0 : otherwise} $$

> The **cumulative distribution funciton** $F(x)$ for a continuous random variable $X$ is defined for ever number $x$ by $$F(x) = P(X \leq x ) \ \int_{- \infty}^{x} f(y)dy $$ For each $x, F(x)$ is the area under the density curve to the left of x. This is illustrated in **Figure 4.5**, where $F(x)$ increases smoothly as x increases.

# Theorems

> **Proposition** : Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with pdf $f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$. Then for any number $a$, $$P(X>a)=1-F(a)$$ and for any two numbers a and b with $a<b$, $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = F(b)-F(a)$$

# Examples

### Exercise 1 (page 146)
**The current in a certain circuit as measured by an ammeter is a continuous random variable X with the following density function:** 
\[ 
f(x) = \begin{cases}
      0.75x +0.2 & 3\leq x\leq 5 \\
      0 &\text{otherwise}\
   \end{cases}
\]

a. **Graph the pdf and verify that the total area under the density curve is indeed 1.** 
```{r, echo=F}
curve(0.075*x+0.2,3,5, ylim = c(0,0.75), ylab = "y")
```

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{3}0+\int_{3}^{5}(0.075x+0.2)dx+\int_{5}^{\infty}0$
=$\frac{0.075x^2}{2}|_{3}^{3}$+$0.2(5-3)$
=$\frac{0.75*5^2}{2}-\frac{0.75*3^2}{2}+0.4$
=1

b. **Calculate $P(X\leq 4)$. How does this probability compare to P($X<4$)?**

= 0.4625, same

c. **Calculate $P(3.5\leq X\leq 4.5)$ and also P($4.5<X$).**

0.5, 0.278125
 
### Exercise 31 (page 155)
**Let X denoter the amount of time a book on two-hour reserve is actually checked out, and suppose the cdf is:** 
\[ 
F(x) = \begin{cases}
      0 & x<0 \\
      \frac{x^2}{4} &0\leq x<2\\
      1 & 2\leq x\
   \end{cases}
\]
a. **Calculate $P(X\leq1)$.**

= 0.25

b. **Calculate $P(0.5\leq X\leq1)$.**

= 0.1875

c. **Calculate $P(X>1.5)$.**

= 0.4375

d. **What is the median checkout duration? $\widetilde{\mu}$ . [solve $0.5=F(\widetilde{\mu})$].**

= 1.4142

e. **Obtain the density function $f(x)$ .**

f(x)=x/2 for 0<x<2

f. **Calculate E(X) .**

1.33

g. **Calculate V(X) and $\sigma x$ .**

= 0.222, 0.471

h. **If the borrower is charged an amount $h(X)=X^2$ when checkout duration is X, compute the expected charge $E[h(X)]$.**

= 2
